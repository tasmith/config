#+TITLE:  Readme for Todd's Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Todd Smith

There are over 1600 files in my Emacs configuration directory!  However, most
are generated or installed under the control of only one file, `init.org'.
Traditionally, Emacs configurations were controlled by a `.emacs' file in a
user's home directory.  Now, it is customary to use a directory `.emacs.d' in
a user's home directory to hold all of the Emacs customization and locally
installed extensions (packages).

When Emacs starts, it attempts to load `.emacs' and if that is not present
(because the configuration is stored it `.emacs.d') it attempts to load `.emacs.d/init.el'.

My `init.org' contains instructions for using the proper commands to generate
`init.el'.  Although the process could be more automated with a Makefile,
the initial configuration of an Emacs environment is complex, involving the
installation of many packages from package repositories.  For this reason, I
prefer to manually generate the `init.el' and proceed to bring up emacs.

Since most of this Emacs configuration is generated, many files in this
directory should not be under version control.  Don't edit `init.el' edit
`init.org' instead and follow instructions found there.
